Privacy Policy – PDF Agenda

1. Data Collection and Use

The PDF Agenda extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, or phone number) without your explicit consent.

Some features of PDF Agenda may require access to data visible on the web pages you visit (such as text, images, videos, sounds, or hyperlinks). This data is processed locally in your browser solely for the purpose of generating PDF files or displaying elements related to the extension. No data is transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.

2. Website Content Interaction

PDF Agenda may interact with visible content on certain web pages (particularly Google Calendar), including:
displayed text (title, description, location, etc.),
images, videos, or audio files,
hyperlinks.

These elements are only used to support the extension’s features (e.g., extracting event details to generate a personalized PDF file). PDF Agenda does not permanently alter any content and does not interfere with the normal functioning of the websites you visit.

The extension claims no rights over the content it processes. All copyrights, logos, trademarks, and other elements remain the property of their respective owners.

3. Required Permissions

PDF Agenda may request certain permissions (such as access to tab content) to extract the data necessary for its operation. These permissions are strictly limited to the intended use of the extension and are not exploited for any other purpose.

4. Data Security and Privacy

All data processed by PDF Agenda is handled locally within your browser. No personal or sensitive data is transmitted to third-party servers. This ensures your information remains private and under your control.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This policy may be updated at any time to reflect changes to the extension or legal requirements. In case of any modification, the updated version will be published on the extension’s page on the Chrome Web Store along with the update date.
